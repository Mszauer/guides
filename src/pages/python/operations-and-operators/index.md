title: Python Operations and Operators
---
**Operators** are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands.

Consider the expression `4 + 5 = 9`. Here, `4` and `5` are called _operands_ and `+` is called _operator_.

## Types of Operator

Python language supports the following types of operators.

*   Arithmetic Operators

|     Operator      |       Description           | Example  |
| :-----------------|:-------------:| :-----:|
| + Addition        | adds the values of operands on either side of the operator                             |`2+3 = 5`|
| - Subtraction     | subtracts the right side operand from the left side operand                            |`5-3 = 2` |
| / Division        | divides the right side operand from the left side operand                              |`5/2 = 2.5` |
| % Modulus         | returns the remainder from dividing the right side operand from the left side operand  |`5%2 = 1`|
| ** Exponent       | performs exoponential operation on numbers.                                            |`2**3 = 8` |
| // Floor division | returns the whole number from dividing the right side operand and left side operand rounded down |`5//2 = 2` |

*   Comparison (Relational) Operators

|     Operator      |       Description           | Example  |
| :-----------------|:-------------:| :-----:|
| ==                | If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition evaluates true.     |`(a==b) = false`|
|!=                 | If values of two operands are not equal, then condition evaluates true          |`(a!=b) = true` |
| >                 | If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition evaluates true  |`(a>b) = false` |
| <                 | If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition evaluates true |`(a<b) = true`|
| >=                | If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition evaluates true |`(a>=b) = false` |
| <=                | If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition evaluates true|`(a<=b) = true` |

*   Assignment Operators
*   Logical Operators
*   Bitwise Operators
*   Membership Operators
*   Identity Operators
